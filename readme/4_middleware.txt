Middleware:
    - way to extend Redux with custom functionality
    - provides third party extension point between dispatch an action and the moment it reaches the reducer
    - uses
        - logging
        - crash reporting
        - performing async tasks etc


we'll use redux-logger
    const logger = reduxLogger.createLogger()

to use a logger Middleware,
    const applyMiddleware = redux.applyMiddleware

    const store = createStore(reducer, applyMiddleware(logger))
