action creator:
    - a function that returns action
    
action:
    - plain js object
    - having a type property
    - only way our application can interact with the store
    - carry some information from our app to redux store
    - describe what happened, but don't describe how the state changes

why action creator, not only actions?
    if we only use actions, 
    if we only pass actions directly, then if we need to add some property in the action
    then we'll need to update in all the places where ever we've used it

    so using action creators will save us.
